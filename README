This is in a bit of a shambles at the moment; I'll get it cleaned up soon.

What this is is a script to manage a Catalyst app running as an external FastCGI
process. The current "stable" version is a bourne sh script, "cat-fcgi-init" in
the root. The very first revision imported is production-ready; the changes
after that are deadend and don't work.

I'm reimplementing as Perl, with the added feature of allowing zero-downtime
restarts; however that's not nearly there yet.

Also living here for now is Log::LSB::InitMsg, a prototype module for logging
using the LSB-approved interface, with emphasis on working properly under Debian
and Ubuntu.
